# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
Bernerd is a student studying for IB at UWC ISAK Japan. He has a lot of things to do in his life, such as Homework, CAS activity, part time job and his hobby. He is finding it is hard to manage his task for those massive amounts of tasks. So, he is willing to have an application that solves that problem. He requires the Login and Register system, which makes his girlfriend use that as well. He wants not only the parts to add tasks, but also edit the tasks to be able to cope with changing deadlines. He didnâ€™t mention how he wants to see the tasks, but because he likes photography, he strongly wants to change the colors of the tasks, to make it easy to see.


## Proposed Solution
Proposed solution:
Design Statement
To solve my client's problem, I will create an application to manage the tasks for him. I will be using Python as the primary programming language for the application, KivyMD for the graphical user interface (GUI), and SQLAlchemy to manipulate the database in which the tasks logs will be stored. The application will consist of a login page, a registration page, main page, page to edit the task, and page to see all of the task.

System
The application to manage appliance usage will be developed on the programming editor PyCharm version 2022.3.2, run on a 2020 MacBook Pro using the OS macOS Big Sur version 13.2.1. Through PyCharm, the application will be coded using Python, KivyMD for the GUI, and SQLite to manipulate the database.

## Software Justification
Python

I will be using Python as the primary programming language for the following reasons. Firstly, Python is high-level, interpreted, simple syntax language, making it accessible to beginner programmers while still maintaining a high degree of flexibility and practicality for a variety of projects. Additionally, Python is regarded as one of the fastest growing programming languages, which means the resources online that may aid in the developement of this project will be abundant. Secondly, ranked above C, I am most familiar coding in Python, which will make the project run much faster than if I would need to learn a new programming language. Lastly, Python is an object-oriented programming language, which will be useful for this project since OOP frameworks are modular, making it easy to identify problems in the code, the code can be reusable through inheritance, and functions can be flexible and usable across multiple classes due to polymorphism.

KivyMD

I will be using KivyMD to create the graphical user interface, which is an open source library capable of creating graphical user interfaces (GUI) for applications. In this project, the GUI will act as the communication between the user, who will input commands and view information through their keyboard and computer screen, and the program, which will manipulate the database to create, add, edit and delete data. The GUI is a crucial component of this application, as it will allow the client, or anyone including those without experience in programming, to easily access the logs.

SQLite
I have chosen to use SQLite as the database management system for this project. SQLite is a lightweight, embedded relational database engine that is perfect for small to medium scale projects. It's highly efficient, fast and reliable, making it a popular choice for developers. Additionally, SQLite is open source and requires no setup or administration, making it easy to integrate with any project. With its ability to handle large amounts of data and its support for SQL, SQLite provides a powerful solution for data storage and retrieval. Furthermore, SQLite is cross-platform compatible, which means that the application can run seamlessly on different operating systems such as Windows, Linux and macOS.


## Success Criteria
1. Login and Register system (Encrypt password)
2. Adding journal (Name, category, due date, tag color)
3. Be able to Edit journal
4. Be able to change color easily
5. Be able to delete the task finished with one button
6. Be able to pick the date easely.
